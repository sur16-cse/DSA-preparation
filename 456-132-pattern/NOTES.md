Use a decreasing stack to store the value of num[k], and use a variable third to store the value of num[j]. All the elements in stack need to bigger than third to satisfy nums[k] < nums[j]. Inversely traverse the array to indicate the first value. if the first value is smaller than the third than return true. if not than put it in the stack.

Since we need to hold the monotone of the stack, if the num[i] value is bigger than the top of the stack, we let third = stack.top() and pop out the top of stack, which mean that we can form a bigger num[k] (nums[ptr]) and a bigger nums[j] (stack.top()), So if the next iterate can let the first value smaller than the third more easily.
